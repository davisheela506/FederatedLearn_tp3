# Federated Learning Security - TP3: Poisoning Attacks and Defenses

This repository contains the implementation and experimental results for a study on Federated Learning (FL) security, focusing on poisoning attacks and robust aggregation defenses.

This practical work (TP3) investigates:
- **Poisoning Attacks** in Federated Learning:
  - Data poisoning (label flipping)
  - Model poisoning (gradient manipulation)
  
- **Defense Mechanisms**:
  - FedMedian (coordinate-wise median aggregation)
  - Krum (distance-based robust aggregation)

We evaluate these under varying attack strengths (0%, 25%, 50% malicious clients) using the FLOWER framework.

## Key Experiments
| Experiment File | Description |
|----------------|------------|
| `fedavg_attackdata_mal0` | Baseline FedAvg (no attacks) |
| `fedavg_attackdata_mal25` | FedAvg with 25% malicious clients |
| `fedavg_attackdata_mal50` | FedAvg with 50% malicious clients |
| `krum_attackdata_mal25` | Krum defense at 25% attack rate |
| `median_attackmodel_mal50` | FedMedian defense at 50% attack rate |

## Graph Explanations
### 1. FedAvg Under Attack
![FedAvg Performance](results_fedavg_alpha10.0_attackdata_mal0_plot.png)
- **Left (Loss)**: Training loss progression
- **Right (Accuracy)**: Validation accuracy
- **Observation**: Stable convergence when no attacks (mal0)

![FedAvg 25% Attack](results_fedavg_alpha10.0_attackdata_mal25_plot.png)
- **Key Change**: Loss increases by 2.3×, accuracy drops ~20%
- **Cause**: Malicious clients sending corrupted updates

### 2. Defense Mechanisms
#### Krum Performance
![Krum Defense](results_krum_alpha10.0_attackdata_mal25_plot.png)
- **Advantage**: Maintains >80% accuracy despite attacks
- **Mechanism**: Filters outliers via distance metrics

#### FedMedian Performance
![FedMedian](results_median_alpha10.0_attackdata_mal50_plot.png)
- **Behavior**: Gradual degradation at 50% attack
- **Limitation**: Fails when attackers >50%

## Results Analysis
### Comparative Performance
| Defense Method | 0% Attack | 25% Attack | 50% Attack |
|---------------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| FedAvg        | 85.2%    | 65.1%     | 24.7%     |
| FedMedian     | 84.9%    | 78.3%     | 39.8%     |
| Krum          | 83.7%    | 81.5%     | 62.4%     |

**Key Insights**:
FedAvg collapses completely under attacks, Krum shows strongest resilience, FedMedian provides moderate protection
